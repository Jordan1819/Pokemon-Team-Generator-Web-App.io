# Overview

This project is a web application/ web page that is accessible through Node.js that allows the user to generate a random Pok√©mon team. This is done via JavaScript and involves creating a function that fetches and awaits the conversion of a txt file to json and then filtering and randomizing the results that are displayed to the user.

The user can test this application by initiating a test server through whatever text editor they are using or through github pages.

My purpose in creating this project was to experiment more with fetching, converting, and manipulating json files. This project also entailed a good amount of work with CSS and proved to be good practice from a front-end development perspective.
