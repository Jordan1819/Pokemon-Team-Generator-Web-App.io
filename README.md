## ✨ **Overview** 🌟

This project allows users to generate a **random Pokémon team** by utilizing **JavaScript** to fetch and convert a **.txt file** to **JSON**, then filter and randomize the Pokémon team results. The app dynamically displays a randomly selected team of Pokémon based on various criteria and user inputs.

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**
The goal of this project was to enhance my **JavaScript** skills, particularly in working with **JSON files**, **fetching data**, and **external APIs**. Writing the functions to handle file conversions and data manipulation was an excellent challenge, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with dynamic web content generation.

## 🌍 **Web Pages** 🖥️

This project consists of two main webpages:
- **index.html:** Main Pokémon team generator page.
- **results.html:** Results and details page for the randomly generated team.

Both pages share the same style and JavaScript files for consistency. The Pokémon data is fetched from an **external API** and is not part of this repository.

You can find the Pokémon API here: [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
